# E-Commerce Customer Intelligence & Churn Prediction Engine

## Project Overview


This project transforms raw transactional data from a UK-based online retailer into a powerful **Customer Decision Intelligence Engine**. Moving beyond standard historical reporting, this project culminates in an interactive, multi-page Flask dashboard that provides actionable insights for proactive, data-driven strategies.

The core of this project involves a deep dive into customer behavior to perform advanced segmentation, predict future customer value, identify churn risk, and uncover hidden product affinities. The final output is an intuitive web application that directly informs marketing, sales, and inventory management strategies to boost profitability and enhance customer retention.

## Interactive Dashboard

The primary deliverable is a multi-page Flask web application designed for non-technical stakeholders, featuring:

* **Executive Home Page:** An at-a-glance overview of key business metrics, including total revenue, unique customers, and overall transaction volume, alongside a trend chart of monthly sales.
* **Churn Analysis Page:** A deep dive into customer retention, featuring an RFM segment treemap color-coded by revenue, a feature importance chart showing the key drivers of churn, and a searchable table of all customers with their churn probability.
* **Affinity Analysis Page:** An interactive tool to explore market basket insights. Users can select any product from a dropdown menu to instantly see a bar chart and recommendation cards detailing the top associated items.

## Business Questions Addressed

This project was designed to answer critical, high-level business questions:

1.  **Customer Value & Segmentation:** Who are our most valuable customers, and what are their distinct behavioral archetypes?
2.  **Churn Prediction:** Which of our high-value customers are at the greatest risk of leaving, and can we identify them proactively?
3.  **Product Affinity:** Which products are most frequently purchased together, and how can we leverage this to increase average order value?
4.  **Behavioral Drivers:** What are the key behaviors (e.g., purchase frequency, product variety) that are statistically linked to high long-term customer value?

## Project Workflow & Methodology

The project follows a multi-phase, agile workflow, moving from foundational data engineering to advanced predictive modeling and final model deployment.

### 1: Data Engineering & Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This phase focused on creating a pristine, analysis-ready dataset and uncovering foundational insights.

* **Robust Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, duplicates, and invalid entries. A key step was **outlier capping** using the IQR method to normalize distributions and reduce extreme skewness from over 300 down to ~1.1.
* **Advanced EDA Techniques:** Went beyond generic plots to uncover deep patterns:
    * **Pareto & Quadrant Analysis:** Confirmed that ~23% of products drive 80% of revenue and categorized the entire product catalog into strategic quadrants (Stars, Niche Winners, Volume Drivers, Underperformers).
    * **Time-Series Decomposition:** Quantitatively separated the monthly sales data into its **Trend, Seasonality, and Residual** components, revealing that the business's growth is primarily driven by seasonal spikes rather than a strong underlying trend.
    * **Customer Similarity Matrix (Computationally Intensive):** Built a **5857x5857** customer-to-customer correlation matrix based on purchasing habits. This computationally demanding step, involving millions of pairwise calculations, formed the basis for a prototype recommendation engine.

### 2: Region-Aware RFM Segmentation

To address the dataset's heavy geographical bias towards the UK, a sophisticated segmentation approach was implemented.

* **Region-Aware Scoring:** Customers were split into "UK" and "Rest of World" cohorts. RFM scores were calculated for each group *independently*, ensuring that international customers were scored fairly against their peers, not against the massive UK majority.
* **Actionable Segments:** Customers were categorized into 10 distinct segments, such as "Champions," "Loyal Customers," and "At-Risk," providing a clear framework for targeted marketing.

### 3: Hypothesis Testing

Used formal statistical tests to validate key business questions with rigor.

* **ANOVA Testing:** Moved beyond simple t-tests to use Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to confirm that key metrics like **Average Purchase Value** and **Product Variety** were statistically different across the multiple customer segments.
* **Key Finding:** Confirmed that the primary drivers separating high-value from low-value customers are **Purchase Frequency** and **Product Variety**, not necessarily the amount they spend per transaction.

### 4: Predictive Churn Modeling

A complete, end-to-end machine learning pipeline was built to proactively identify customers at risk of churning.

* **Multi-Algorithm Benchmarking:** Trained and evaluated a suite of powerful classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) using 5-fold cross-validation to select the best-performing algorithm.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning (Computationally Intensive):** Employed **GridSearchCV** to systematically search for the optimal parameters for the winning model (Gradient Boosting), ensuring maximum predictive performance.
* **Rigorous Evaluation:** The final, tuned model was evaluated on a held-out test set, achieving an exceptional **ROC AUC of 0.99+**. The evaluation included a detailed classification report, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and a feature importance analysis, which confirmed that **Recency** is the single most important predictor of churn.

### 5: Market Basket & Affinity Analysis

Uncovered hidden product relationships to power cross-selling strategies.

* **Apriori Algorithm:** Applied the Apriori algorithm to the transaction data to find frequent itemsets.
* **Association Rules:** Generated and filtered association rules to find product pairs with high **confidence** and **lift** (>56 for top pairs), resulting in a clean, actionable list of "if-then" recommendations (e.g., customers who buy "POPPY'S PLAYHOUSE LIVINGROOM" are extremely likely to buy the "KITCHEN").
